    <H1>Backpacking</H1>
    <p>Backpacking is an extension of camping that lets you get even more connected with nature.
    Rather than simply driving to a spot to put up a tent, backpacking is when you load a backpack
    with everything you need to a period of time, hike to a destination, and camp along the way.</p>
    <p>Here is a link to some of the best trails in America!</p>
